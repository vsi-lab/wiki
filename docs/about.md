The Vision Systems and Intelligence (VSI) Laboratory was established in 2023 with the primary objective of researching computer vision, medical image analysis, and deep learning. 


We aim to develop deep learning systems that utilize computationally efficient models designed specifically for embedded computer vision systems and medical imaging applications. Our focus extends to exploring the development of intelligent systems for a diverse range of applications, including unmanned vehicles, face analysis, hyperspectral imaging, and surgical AI systems.


Further, we actively foster interdisciplinary collaboration within the domains of computer vision and medical imaging.
