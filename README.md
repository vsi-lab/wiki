- Clone the git repository.
- Install using Python manage `pip install mkdocs-material`
- Run the project site locally using `mkdocs serve` after changing to the repository.
- The site URL is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/wiki/`.

# Instructions

## Project skeleton
- To configure the pages and subpages, modify the page structure in `mkdocs.yml` under `nav`. 
- Add a markdown file inside `docs` folder and add an entry ` 'Title': name.md` where `Title` is the page title displayed in the navigation bar and `name.md` the name of the corresponding markdown file.
-  Edit the markdown files as needed.

## Theme customization
- The design can be customized more precisely by adding CSS or JS files and/or overriding the theme. Check below resources for instructions
